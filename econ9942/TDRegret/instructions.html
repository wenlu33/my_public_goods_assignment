    </h6>
        <p>
        There are 8 subjects participating in this experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, you will be randomly and anonymously assigned with a letter ID, then instructions will be distributed. The experiment will be repeated for 10 rounds. At the beginning of the first round 4 pairs will be formed randomly and anonymously. In each round, you and your partnerâ€™s choices will determine the amount earned. The results of you and the subject who matched with you will be communicated at the end of each round. At the end of the experiment, the earnings of each participant will be determined as the sum of their earnings of the 10 rounds.
